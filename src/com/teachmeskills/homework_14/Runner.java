 * Valid document numbers docnum should be recorded in one report file.
 * Valid contract numbers should be recorded in another report file.
 * Errors, if they occur, should be recorded in the error_log.txt file
 * Logs should be written to the file execution_log.txt
 * Invalid document numbers should be recorded in another report file,
 * but after the document numbers you should add information about why this
